            "An Alternative Investment is an investment that is not traded on an exchange and is usually more complex than exchange traded products like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.",

Please ensure your financial professional provides you with the most up-to-date prospectus or PPM for the offering. It is also important that you read the prospectus or PPM because they provide important information and disclosures to you about the investment which may influence your decision to invest.",
